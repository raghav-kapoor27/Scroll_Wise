⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT FOR YOUTUBE USERS

You must turn OFF "Video previews" in YouTube settings for this extension to work correctly.

YouTube’s built-in autoplay previews override blur filters.
When previews are disabled, the extension can fully control the thumbnails and prevent disturbing videos from flashing before the blur is applied.

How to disable YouTube video previews

Open YouTube.

Click your profile picture (top-right).

Go to Settings → Playback and performance.

Find Video previews.

Turn it OFF.

Without this step, blurred content may still briefly show before being hidden — so please make sure it’s disabled.

✔️ Everything Is Set

Once installed:

The extension blurs sensitive videos on supported platforms.

Clicking a blurred video shows a small confirmation prompt.

You remain in full control while still scrolling normally.
